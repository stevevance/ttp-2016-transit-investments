## About
Transit Explorer was developed by Yonah Freemark and Steven Vance.

Code includes Google Analytics and Maptiks settings specific to the site. If using the code elsewhere, adapt these settings for your specific site's needs.

## Geographic data
The geographic data represents existing and future transit lines and future transit stations and combines custom-created data and data from open sources. 

### Custom data

### Open data
-Some data from [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org), including Mexico City, MX, and other cities. It was extracted by following this [tutorial to use Overpass Turbo](http://www.stevencanplan.com/2015/12/how-to-extract-highways-and-subway-lines-from-openstreetmap-as-a-shapefile/).
